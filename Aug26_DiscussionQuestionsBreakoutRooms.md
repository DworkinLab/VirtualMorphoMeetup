# Questions to discuss in breakout rooms.

We will only be in the breakout rooms for 10-15 minutes. Time accordingly.

Also if you choose (or are willing to be chosen) to facilitate the breakout groups, try to get one participant to take some notes to share to the group (and maybe post in the chat session so we can save it all).

##  The future of the virtual morphometrics meeting:
1. In the short term, how do we morph these meetings into something enough participants will want to do while many of us are now busy again (possibly busier than ever) with teaching, research, classes, etc?

2. Assuming we go to a more community based model, how frequently should we meet and still be able to sustain the meeting. Weekly? Forntnightly? Monthly?

3. What should be the make up of what we do since we will be less able to have people focus on delivering workshops. Journal clubs (How frequently)? Data/analysis discussions? short presentations (i..e 2 x 20 minutes with plenty of time for questions)?

4. If we do journal clubs, does it make more sense to organize into smaller groups (5-10 participants each) so it is easier for everyone to participate? Do we try to aim for each group to the same paper each week (so we can still discuss it), or let groups develop independently? Will this have any negative effects?

5. What other thoughts and ideas do you have?



## A community portal for morphometrics.
Those of us of a certain generation widely used SB Morphometrics maintained by Dr. Rohlf as our homebase. Now of course there are even more resources, and while SB Morphometrics is still maintained to some degree, it is worth asking whether we can build on its model for a community maintained portal.  However, what the goals are, and how this is achieved are totally open.

1. Do we even need such a portal. Are most of the resources for GM (access to materials, software, courses, data) sufficiently accessible via google, morphmet etc?

2. What would be 3-4 key components you would want to see in such a community maintained portal (teaching resources, learning resources, access to current workshops, access to landmark data, links to software, example scripts for common analysis workflows)? What are the greatest needs you have now? That you had 2 years ago? That you think you will have in 2 years?

3. Do you have any good examples of wikis or other community portals for research that would serve as a good template?
Should the materials be lightly curated (i.e. a small group of individuals are tasked with approving submissions to make sure they are actually relevant to morphometrics, and are not say spam...) or do we make it open for all to directly contribute without curation?

4. How do we figure a good platform that would for this?
Would we want to move things directly onto this platform, or just have it link to the resources?

5. Anything else?

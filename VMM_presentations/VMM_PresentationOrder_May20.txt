Kelly  - Evolutionary functional morphology (fish). Image segmentation. Using ML on GMM data. (vs pure ML on images?). Best practices for 3D GMM.

Quentin - Actic Charr  Evolutionary biology - interested in developing more skills on nested and crossed designs generally, and in geomorph specifically

Marina - Evolutionary genetics and morphology of adaptive divergence in charr (trophic preferences). Combine GMM with QTL mapping

Adriana - Evolutionary Functional Morphology, relationship between diet, feeding trophic level and morphology, PCM - GMM. really interest in slicerMorph skills.

Sergey - Wheat leaves under different nutrient regimes - FA components

Miriam - Evolutionary morphology of a highly static trait (squirrels!!). GMM and comparative methods, modularity and integration, relating evolution of morphology to ecology/geography.

James - development of new methods in GM and time-series (longitudinal). Integrate time series methods for GM data types. Any software to show us?

Mahendiran - Birds, Rice. Non-invase methods for data acquisition.

Ian 

Nicole - Human, physical anthropology. FEA etc. General interest in learning more about shape modeling.


Chris - phenotypic diversification (furry verts), PCM - GMM

Krista - vertebrate Functional morphology and evolution. How to deal with variable curves?

Cori - Evolutionary Functional morphology in fish, PCM for GM data
 goals: improve skills for 3D shape analysis and modeling


Katya - Human physical anthropology, morphology and climactic adaptations. Group assignments (lda, cva, etc). combining morphology with GIS info? Assessing probabilities of likelihood of a fossil's adaptations (? not entirely sure what KS means).

# Virtual Morphometrics Meetup

- This is the repository for scripts and other files that we will use for the Virtual Morphometrics meetings.

## using pairwise in geomorph (ID)
- Materials from April 29th (using `r pairwise()` in `r RRPP` or `r geomorph`):
    - the `r .Rmd`  file that can be rendered ("knit") for slides or "purl" for just the `R` code. That link is [here](./VirtualMorphMeet_April29_2020.Rmd)
    - the markdown file (rendered to show output) is [here](./VirtualMorphMeet_April29_2020.md)
    - Abbreviated and anonymized output from the chat window from the meeting is [here](April29_ZoomChatHighlights.txt)

## SlicerMorph (MM and team)
- On May 6th,2020 the SlicerMorph team will be doing a short introduction on their tools for 3D scans.
    - The link for materials for this tutorial are [here](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/VMM).
    - The SlicerMorph website is [here](https://slicermorph.github.io/)

## Introduction to PCM for GMM (DA)
- May 27th, 2020 - Dr. Dean Adams is providing a birds eye view of phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM) in the context of GMM.
  - The link for the `r .Rmd` file is [here](./PCM-Intro.Rmd).
   the `r .Rmd`  file that can be rendered ("knit") for slides or "purl" for just the `R` code. In this case there are some associated images in the `PCM-Image` folder. So if you are unfamilar with how to clone a git repo, go to the big green button that says "clone or download", download the zipped file, unzip it on your computer, and then open a fresh instance of Rstudio and you should be able to click on the `r .Rmd` files and they will be able to knit (rendered). You may need to change your working directory if you already had Rstudio open.
   - If you prefer to follow along with the slides, this same repository (that you just downloaded or clones) has a self-contained file `PCM-Intro.html` that if you have locally on your computer, and click it, it will open a beautiful presentation in your browser.  

   -- The chat transcript for this meeting (anonymized) is [here](./May27_2020_VMM_ChatHighlights.txt) in case you wanted to grab the references, etc.


## Combining landmark configurations (MC)
- June 17th, 2020: Dr. Michael Collyer Making Heads or Tails of Combined Landmark Configurations in GM data.

    - The link for the `r .Rmd` file is [here](./combine.subsets.talk/heads.or.tails.combined.landmarks.Rmd). To render this in R studio you will need some associated files so download or clone the repository (see instructions above for this). **Please Note** that this depends on the most recent version of geomorph (v3.3.1), so you may wish to update geomorph. 
    - Alternatively you can use j the self contained `.html` slides in the repo (just click on the html file after download.)
    - Or just look at it on github [here](./combine.subsets.talk/heads.or.tails.combined.landmarks.md). Please note that github (for some reason) does not support LaTeX formatting so the equations won't look right (they will in the slides or in R studio.)

## Other stuff

- ID needs to re-organize this, sorry!

- However feel free to use the files here to help you and help others.

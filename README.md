# Virtual Morphometrics Meetup

- This is just a repository for scripts and other files that we will use for the Virtual Morphometrics meeting.

- Materials from April 29th (using `r pairwise()` in `r RRPP` or `r geomorph`):
    - the `r .Rmd`  file that can be rendered ("knit") for slides or "purl" for just the `R` code. That link is [here](./VirtualMorphMeet_April29_2020.Rmd)
    - the markdown file (rendered to show output) is [here](./VirtualMorphMeet_April29_2020.md)
    - Abbreviated and anonymized output from the chat window from the meeting is [here](April29_ZoomChatHighlights.txt)


- On May 6th,2020 the SlicerMorph team will be doing a short introduction on their tools for 3D scans.
    - The link for materials for this tutorial are [here](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/VMM).
    - The SlicerMorph website is [here](https://slicermorph.github.io/)

- May 27th, 2020 - Dr. Dean Adams is providing a birds eye view of phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM) in the context of GMM.
  - The link for the `r .Rmd` file is [here](./PCM-Intro.Rmd).
   the `r .Rmd`  file that can be rendered ("knit") for slides or "purl" for just the `R` code. In this case there are some associated images in the `PCM-Image` folder. So if you are unfamilar with how to clone a git repo, go to the big green button that says "clone or download", download the zipped file, unzip it on your computer, and then open a fresh instance of Rstudio and you should be able to click on the `r .Rmd` files and they will be able to knit (rendered). You may need to change your working directory if you already had Rstudio open.
   - If you prefer to follow along with the slides, this same repository (that you just downloaded or clones) has a self-contained file `PCM-Intro.html` that if you have locally on your computer, and click it, it will open a beautiful presentation in your browser.  

   -- The chat transcript for this meeting (anonymized) is [here](./May27_2020_VMM_ChatHighlights.txt) in case you wanted to grab the references, etc.

- Since I just put it up, I have not given it any particular structure (other than a simple .gitignore). It will likely be changing a fair bit in the short term (as of April 28th 2020).

- However feel free to use the files here to help you and help others.

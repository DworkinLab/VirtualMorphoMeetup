# Virtual Morphometrics Meetup

- This is just a repository for scripts and other files that we will use for the Virtual Morphometrics meeting.

- Since I just put it up, I have not given it any particular structure (other than a simple .gitignore). It will likely be changing a fair bit in the short term (as of April 28th 2020).

- However feel free to use the files here to help you and help others.


more soon.

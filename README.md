# Virtual Morphometrics Meetup

- This is just a repository for scripts and other files that we will use for the Virtual Morphometrics meeting.

- Materials from April 29th (using `r pairwise()` in `r RRPP` or `r geomorph`):
    - the `r .Rmd`  file that can be rendered ("knit") for slides or "purl" for just the `R` code. That link is [here](./VirtualMorphMeet_April29_2020.Rmd)
    - the markdown file (rendered to show output) is [here](./VirtualMorphMeet_April29_2020.md)
    - Abbreviated and anonymized output from the chat window from the meeting is [here](April29_ZoomChatHighlights.txt)


- On May 6th,2020 the SlicerMorph team will be doing a short introduction on their tools for 3D scans.
    - The link for materials for this tutorial are [here](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/VMM).
    - The SlicerMorph website is [here](https://slicermorph.github.io/)

- Since I just put it up, I have not given it any particular structure (other than a simple .gitignore). It will likely be changing a fair bit in the short term (as of April 28th 2020).

- However feel free to use the files here to help you and help others.

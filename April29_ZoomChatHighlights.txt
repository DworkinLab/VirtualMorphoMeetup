11:19:57	 From ID : If you want to run the code you can use it with the .Rmd file, just do each code "chunk" at a time (look for the little green triangle on the side of each block).

If all of the documentation and formatting is distracting and you just want the R code

Extract these using purl (knitr library)
i.e:

#In R studio load the knitr package (should already be installed).

library(knitr)
#then (make sure file is in your working directory or change accordingly.

purl("VirtualMorphMeet_April29_2020.Rmd", "JustTheCodePlease.R", documentation = 0)
